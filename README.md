* Implemnted a Variational Quantum Eigensolver to find the lowest eigenvalue of a given hamiltonian matrix.
* Besides the actual circuit also tested various cases by changing number of shots for the "QASM" simulator.
* Added a noise model using IBM backend Fake_tokyo and plotted the difference found as a result of the same.
